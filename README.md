# Twitter Bootstrap (Newsweek)
This is my 7th HTML/CSS project. It is a clone Newsweek's [homepage](http://www.newsweek.com/).
To see the exact version go to this [web archive](http://web.archive.org/), and look for the date that is closest to July 21st, 2017.

The purpose of this project was to work on my working knowledge of how bootstap works. On a higher level it was also an introduction
into the world of frameworks.

It is not currently completed as I kinda lost interest. Will revisit later.

This project can be found on my website [here](http://joshuawootonn.com/newsweek-bootstrap/)!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap?ref=lc-pb)!
